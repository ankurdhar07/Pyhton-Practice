# 🐍 Python Practice

Welcome to my **Python Practice Repository** 🚀  
Here, I upload my daily practice codes as I learn Python step by step.  
This repository will act as a journal of my coding journey.

## 📂 Current Progress

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository and run the practice files using Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankurdhar07/Pyhton-Practice.git
2. Go inside the project folder
cd Python-Practice/Practices

✨ Notes

- Each file is self-contained and demonstrates one concept in Python.
